This project focuses on Robust Intelligent Posture Estimation to aid fitness enthusiasts in improving workout techniques and preventing injuries. The system integrates MediaPipe and OpenCV to estimate human body posture in real-time. It provides feedback based on the user's form and suggests corrective measures during exercises like bicep curls. The solution is designed to work in various environments and can be extended to cover other exercises, making it ideal for home-based fitness training or gym applications.
